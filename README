PIPELINE:

1) Alignment is done with SSAHA2, using the default 'Sanger' hashing
  and matching aoptions.

2) The 'raw' SSAHA2 output is filtered using the 'depth_filter.plx'
  Perl script using a coverage (-c) of 0.8 and a depth (-d) of 3.

3) The 'raw GFF' is generated directly from the filtered SSAHA2
  alignment results using the 'ssaha_to_gff.plx' Perl script.

4) The 'paired GFF' is generated using the 'raw GFF' and a
  bambus-style 'mates' file using the 'to_gff.plx' Perl script.

5) The 'paired GFF' is loaded into GBrowse, and is visualized using
  the 'clone.conf' GB Perl-style configuration

DM_BES:

A BAC library was constructed by Lucigen from Solanum phureja DM1-3
516R44 (CIP801092). End sequences were generated using primers in the
vector (pSMART) using Sanger sequencing at the J Craig Venter
Institute. All sequences are in GenBank (Accession numbers GS025504
...). A total of 156,485 sequences are found in this file.

RH_BES:

A BAC library (library name RHPOTKEY) was constructed by Keygene from
Solanum tuberosum clone RH89-039-16. The library comprises a mixture
of EcoRI and HindIII partial digest genomic DNA fragemnts. End
sequences were generated using primers in the vector (pIndigoBAC-5)
using Sanger sequencing at the J Craig Venter Institute. All sequences
are in GenBank (Accession numbers EI367122-EI391525,
EI812397-EI846477, ER788642-ER870415). A total of 140,259 sequences
are found in this file.
